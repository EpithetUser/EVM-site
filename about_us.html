        With the foresight and passion to revolutionise everyday mobility,
        PASCAL set out to take action back in 2001. We realised our dream of a
        sustainable future and set in motion a chain of events that would later
        bring Eco-Friendly Mobility within everyone's grasp.
        <br /><br />
        Through research and innovation, we design Electric vehicles that power
        India through New Age Energy. Take charge of your journey with PASCAL's
        sustainable mobility and ride towards a cleaner and greener planet.

        Towards a future that rides on Sustainable Mobility
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        Personal transport is of high importance in our society and the 2020
        pandemic situation has reinforced this situation. At the same time,
        transport contributes to local emissions, which need to be reduced in
        the face of climate change. Changing from vehicles with internal
        combustion engines to light electric vehicles could be one promising
        approach. Therefore, we need to understand mobility patterns and
        attitudes towards E-mobility to create sustainable transport solutions
        that will be broadly accepted.
